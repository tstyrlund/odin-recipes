    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"I received this recipe several years ago from a family member who swore it was a great romantic meal. She was right. My husband asks me to make this meal every time we have a date night. The quantity of ingredients look intimidating, but don't let them fool you. It's easy and delicious! The whipping cream gives it a creamy texture that you just can't get enough of!"</p>

      <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>&frac13; cup minced onion</li>
      <li>1 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes with juice</li>
      <li>&frac12; teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>&frac14; cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>&frac13; cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>&frac12; teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
      <li>3 5 oz skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>&frac34; cup shredded Mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic and onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 2 minutes. Pour in diced tomatoes and sugar. Increase heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, and continue simmering for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once the sauce has simmered, stir in the cream and season to taste with salt and pepper. Simmer for an additional 3 minutes. Lower heat and keep sauce warm.</li>
      <li>Stir together bread crumbs, 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, and dried oregano; set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together egg and 2 tablespoons milk until blended. Dip chicken breasts into the egg, then press into breadcrumb mixture to coat both sides, shaking off excess.</li>
      <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken breasts and cook on both sides until they reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), and the bread crumb crust is golden brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>To serve, spoon sauce over chicken and top with Mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Let stand a few minutes until the cheese has melted from the heat of the sauce.</li>
